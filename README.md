Theme bundle for the Howl editor (http://howl.io/)

## Installation

Clone or download into `~/.howl/bundles`. Please save it under a different folder name because I forgot that the official Howl themes bundle is already named `howl_themes`. I have it under `custom_themes` for example.

The colors might change over time, as I am tweaking themes to my liking.

You may also just copy paste this:

`git clone https://github.com/rokf/howl_themes ~/.howl/bundles/custom_themes`

## Contains

- Berrykai - tweaked blue-ish Monokai
- Play - built upon Monokai but light with a background pattern
- Flatron

## Patterns

They're from http://subtlepatterns.com/, I didn't make them.
