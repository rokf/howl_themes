Theme bundle for the Howl editor (http://howl.io/)

## Installation

Clone or download into `~/.howl/bundles`.
Please save it under a different folder name because I forgot that the official Howl themes bundle is already named `howl_themes`. I have it under `custom_themes` for example.

The colors might change over time, as I am tweaking themes to my liking.

You may also just copy paste this:

`git clone https://github.com/rokf/howl_themes ~/.howl/bundles/custom_themes`

## Contains
- Berrykai (tweaked Monokai)
- Play (light)
- Flatron (dark)
- Darkness (dark grayscale theme with colored strings and numbers)
- Light (turned around Darkness)
- Fruity (light)
- Eleterm (dark)
